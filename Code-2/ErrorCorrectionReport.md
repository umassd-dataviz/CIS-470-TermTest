Errors:
Logical Error in Age Validation: The condition for validating the age (if (patientAge < 0 && patientAge >= 130)) uses the logical AND operator (&&) instead of the logical OR operator (||), which makes the condition incorrect.
Incorrect Systolic Diagnosis Logic: The conditions for assigning the systolic diagnosis are not correctly ordered, and the thresholds are incorrect. For example, if (systolic > 120) should be if (systolic < 120) for the "NORMAL" diagnosis.
Missing Systolic and Diastolic Diagnosis Conditions: The conditions for "HYPERTENSIVE_CRISIS" are missing for both systolic and diastolic diagnoses.
Incorrect Comparison in Final Diagnosis: The comparison if (severityLevels[diastolicDiagnosis] >= severityLevels[systolicDiagnosis]) uses >= instead of >, which could lead to incorrect diagnosis in some cases.

Fixes:
Correct Age Validation Logic: The logical operator was corrected to || to properly validate the age range.
Correct Systolic Diagnosis Logic: The conditions for assigning the systolic diagnosis were reordered and corrected to use the appropriate thresholds.
Add Missing Diagnosis Conditions: Conditions for "HYPERTENSIVE_CRISIS" were added for both systolic and diastolic diagnoses.
Correct Final Diagnosis Comparison: The comparison was corrected to use > to ensure the more severe diagnosis is correctly assigned.
