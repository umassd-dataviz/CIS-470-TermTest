1. Validation of Age:

Original Code: if (patientAge < 0 && patientAge >= 130) {
Issue: The logical operator used was && instead of ||, which meant that the condition would never be true.

Fix: Changed the logical operator to || to correctly validate the age range.

Fixed Code: if (patientAge < 0 || patientAge >= 130) {

2. Diagnosis Assignment for Systolic Readings:

Original Code:
javascript
Copy code
if (systolic > 120) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "NORMAL";
} else if (systolic < 140) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "PREHYPERTENSION";
}

Issue: The condition systolic > 120 for NORMAL diagnosis was incorrect, and the subsequent conditions were not correctly ordered.

Fix: Corrected the condition for NORMAL diagnosis and rearranged the conditions to ensure proper diagnosis assignment.
Fixed Code:
javascript
Copy code
if (systolic < 120) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "NORMAL";
} else if (systolic < 140) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "PREHYPERTENSION";
} else if (systolic < 160) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "STAGE_1_HBP";
} else if (systolic < 180) {
  systolicDiagnosis = "STAGE_2_HBP";
} else {
  systolicDiagnosis = "HYPERTENSIVE_CRISIS";
}
3. Comparison of Severity Levels:

Original Code: if (severityLevels[diastolicDiagnosis] >= severityLevels[systolicDiagnosis]) {

Issue: The comparison used >= which could lead to incorrect diagnosis assignment in certain cases.

Fix: Changed the comparison operator to > to ensure that the diagnosis with the higher severity level is returned.
Fixed Code: if (severityLevels[diastolicDiagnosis] > severityLevels[systolicDiagnosis]) {
