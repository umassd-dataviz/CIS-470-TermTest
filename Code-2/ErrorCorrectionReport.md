Age Validation Error:
The code checks to make sure age isn't less than 0 and greater than 130. This logic is incorrect, and instead, it should look for if age is less than 0 or if it is greater than 130.

Systolis Diagnostic Error:
The function doesn't correctly put the blood pressures in the right category for distolic. To fix this, Normal would be less than 120 rather than greater than 120, prehypertension would be between 120 and 139, stage 1 HBP would be between 140 and 159, stage 2 HBP would be greater than or equal to 160, and hypertensive crisis would be greater than 180.
