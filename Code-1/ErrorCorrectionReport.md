Errors in calculatePrice Function:

Redundant Condition Check:

Error: The nested if statement if (isStudent || hasCoupon) was redundant because it duplicated the outer if condition.
Fix: Removed the redundant nested if statement to ensure the subsequent conditions for applying discounts are correctly evaluated.
Incorrect Discount Conditions:

Error: The conditions for applying the 10% and 5% discounts were incorrect due to repeated checks of if (hasCoupon). This caused the 10% student discount and the 5% coupon discount to be unreachable.
Fix: Changed the conditions to else if (isStudent && !hasCoupon) for the 10% student discount and else if (!isStudent && hasCoupon) for the 5% coupon discount, ensuring all discount scenarios are correctly handled.
Missing Type Validation for isStudent and hasCoupon:

Error: The function did not validate the types of isStudent and hasCoupon, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-boolean values were passed.
Fix: Added type validation checks to ensure that both isStudent and hasCoupon are boolean values, throwing an error if not.

Errors in Test Cases:

Incorrect Expectation in "Output price is greater than input price" Test:
Error: This test case expected an error with the message "Invalid price: Price must be a positive number." when the output price was not greater than the input price. The expectation was incorrect because the function does not check for this condition, and the input price was valid.
Fix: We changed the expectation to directly compare the output price with the input price, rather than expecting an error.
